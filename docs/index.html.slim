        h1 Less is more
        p Traditional CSS frameworks include an overwhelming and unnecessary amount of bloat. Vital is built on the principal that less is more. Working with less code means there are fewer bugs to squash and less documentation to read. Less time spent coding means more time to focus on your next killer feature.

        h1 Regain productivity
        p Often times a large CSS framework is used to speed up the time to market or to enforce consistency, but when a project grows beyond the initial scope of a concept, development becomes more difficult and time consuming. Vital reduces workflow inefficiencies because there is less to learn and maintain.
